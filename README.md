# Distraction Free Web

Personal filters for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) to make various web pages less distracting.

These filter lists will remove many elements from websites such as [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), etc to make them less distracting.

The main motivation is to reduce these websites to the actual service they provide to end users who do not have an account.

These filters are highly opinionated. For example, youtube is considered to be a service purely to search for and watch videos (no shorts, recommendations or comments). Since anything else is considered distracting, the filters remove many UI elements.
